      My name is Nicole Nguyen, and my love for coding started when I was introduced <br>
      to Xanga. I was able to continue gaining more experiencewith MySpace. I didn't <br>
      realize that coding was a career choice, instead ventured into veterinarian medicine <br>
      and healthcare. I developed skills in relationship building, creating solutions, and<br>
      working across teams. I am very friendly and easy to work with. I just completed a 14 <br>
      weeks full stack software develpoment bootcamp. Iâ€™m ready to bring my love of code <br>
      and my skills to a technology team, where I can continue creating customized products and grow. <br>
